Hello <%=h @user.login %>,
    A new user(<%= @new_user.full_name %>) request for your project: <%= @project_name %> has been placed.
    Please follow the url to tolkin to allow access to your project for this user.
    <%=h @url %>
Thanks,
Tolkin Team.
p.s: The same email has been sent to other managers too. So it might happen they would have allowed the user access before you try to.
