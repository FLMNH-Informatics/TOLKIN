def_each
========

Allows easy declaration of multiple methods at once.  See

for more information.

Monkey-patched into Class

Note: define_method call from within def_each is slower than just declaring
methods individually.  There may be issues with memory leaks, but it is likely
all significant issues have been resolved at this point in time.
